if we get any request then it iwll coem first envent and became a queue   after event queu it goes with event loop   use fifo principal 
these are two type blocking and no blovking task means syn and sync   if this chec kthe process if this non blovcking operation then process it 

blocking operation goes to the thread pool 

thread pool is like pool of thread and thread are resposible to do the work orr precess of blocking opertations if workers are avilabel and then process the no blocking operattion
